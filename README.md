# Introduction

Apify is an alternative to complex enterprise frameworks. It's small, easy to understand 
and use. If you are familiar with the Zend Framework, then you already know how to use Apify.

The Apify library allows developers to quickly create Web applications and RESTful Web services. 

Web services are a great way to extend your application, however, adding a Web API 
to an existing web application can be a tedious and time-consuming task. Apify was 
developed to ease that pain. It takes certain common patterns found in most web services 
and abstract them so that you can quickly write Web APIs without having to write too much 
code. Example: [UsersController][9].

setting the "debug" option to false in the config.php file.

# Demo

To demonstrate the possibilities of Apify and to show how it works, 
I've created http://www.apifysnippets.com, a web application/service 
that allows Facebook users to submit posts, vote and add comments.
